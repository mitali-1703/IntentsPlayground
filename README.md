# IntentsPlayground

I have made an Intent based application to do some intent based functions.

Download [APK](https://github.com/mitali-1703/IntentsPlayground/releases/download/latest/counter.apk) for the application.

## Features in the application

* Increment quantity

* Decrement quantity

* Open new activity

* Implicit Intents to dial number, share text and open web pages

* To send and receive data between activities

## Previews of the application
